                    </h3>
                    <p>They believe they control how things happen or don’t, and proactively make a choice to focus on them or not.
                        Leaders look into the mirror and take ownership for failures while looking out of the window giving their teams credit for their successes

                        Leaders are great communicators
                    </h3>
                    <p>They just don’t think they are right, they can also verbalise and make other people see
                        the world through their eyes. This doesn’t mean that they are only sellers, they also
                        believe and repeatedly prove what they are saying is true. A good leader conveys expectations,
                        feedback, challenges and context etc. in a simple, honest and timely manner, while maintaining
                        an open channel for the same things to flow upwards from the people they lead

                        Leaders listen
                    </h3>
                    <p>The truth is, someone in a position of leadership will likely have more knowledge and or experience
                        in a given situation, but if someone has a perspective to share, it's important for a leader to demonstrate
                        a willingness to listen and accept that there may be more realities than just the one they know.
                        They can totally choose not to follow said perspective, but listening builds trust and respect
                    </p>

                        Leaders believe they can change anything
                    </h3>
                    <p>This is not foolish optimism, but rather
                        a belief that they can make a positive impact by leveraging the knowledge of others or learning on their own.
                        Leaders deeply understand that the ability to help people do better is a powerful weapon for change

                    <p>The ability to start with an idea and take it to a point where it can be a reality, starts with a leader's willingness to lead the change.
                        Leaders share their ideas and beliefs openly in order to make them a reality

                    </h3>
                    <p>Things will always have a tendency to slow down or settle into a routine. A leader constantly avoids this sloth and challenges everyone to a higher goal. It means avoiding stasis, in every way possible.
                        Leadership is the ability to constantly drive forward momentum

                    <p>Given the information they have. In addition to making things happen, they also seek and provide clarity in that direction by engaging in a
                        constant balance between advocacy and inquiry. For a leader, local optima does not matter

                        Leaders treat tough times as tough problems, nothing more
                    </h3>
                    <p>They have the intellectual honesty to admit their mistakes, and move on with the knowledge of the lessons,
                        without being weighed down by the baggage. They deeply understand that we are
                        better off watching the next move, than dwelling on the reasons for landing in tough times

                        Leaders make choices that have a bias towards action
                    </h3>
                    <p>Delaying a decision is a decision too. Leaders consciously differentiate between problems that
                        are one-way doors and two-way doors, and solve for speed in decision making, irrespective
                    </p>

                        Leaders are oriented towards solving problems, not solving for people
                    </h3>
                    <p>Leaders are fearless while challenging assumptions when they disagree, especially because they
                        operate from deep-rooted, mission-oriented convictions. While people are necessary to get the work done, having great people who don’t get outcomes is a
                        counterproductive. Leaders fixate on the outcomes, knowing the right people will align themselves

                        Leaders raise the bar on each and every hire
                    </h3>
                    <p>They always seek to hire people who will raise the bar for the team on some vector. They are keenly looking to find, hire and train people to be better than themselves,

                        Leaders have a learning mindset
                    </h3>
                    <p>They are open to new ideas and have a reasonable amount of meaningful input for each aspect of the business. They understand that when we try to defend our egos, rather than grow and change, we end up perfectly designed for a world that happened already, instead of growing better able to handle the world that is coming next. With this in mind – they constantly seek feedback
                        and invest in their own and the organisations learning at large
